# Hackathon
Hand gesture, Machine Learning Model in Python

## Tech-Stack
Flask, TensorFlow, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, OpenCV for Python, Google Collab, MediaPipe, SKLearn, MatPlot.
From tensorflow.keras.models we imported Sequential
From tensorflow.keras.layers we imported LSTM, Dense
From tensorflow.keras.callbacks we imported TensorBoard

## Future Prospects:
Here are the few things, we are planning to add in future.
1. Connect our machine lerning model with our web chat app.
2. Add language translator.
3. Add sign language learning data.
